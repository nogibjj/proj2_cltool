For this project, I wanted to create an easy way to access an online database 
that is updated with some regularity as well as a method to easily query it
using keywords. I like to stay updated on current life science research, so 
I utilized the the 'Most Downloaded Articles' list on Elsevier found at 
https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-advanced-research/most-downloaded-articles .
